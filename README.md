This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The main objective was to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history and analyze the patterns within each segment. By doing this, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior, identify high-value customers, and design better strategies for marketing and customer retention.
The approach began with preparing and cleaning the dataset, followed by selecting meaningful features such as income levels and spending scores that reflect purchasing behavior. Since features often exist on different scales, data standardization was applied to ensure that all attributes contribute equally to the clustering process. After preprocessing, the K-Means algorithm was used to divide customers into different clusters. Each cluster represents a distinct group of customers who share similar purchasing patterns.
The results were visualized using scatter plots where each color represents a different cluster, and the centroids were marked to show the center of each group. These visualizations made the clusters easy to interpret, helping to distinguish between high-spending customers, budget-conscious buyers, and average spenders. The insights gained from this segmentation can be directly applied in real-world retail scenarios to improve decision-making, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.
This task gave me hands-on experience with unsupervised learning techniques and taught me the importance of feature selection, preprocessing, and visualization in clustering problems. It also highlighted how data science can provide valuable business insights by transforming raw purchase data into clear and actionable segments.
